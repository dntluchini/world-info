# World-Info 🌐
A simple app that provides data from any place in the world.<br>
This is my first React project, where I'm practicing the use of hooks 🪝 and conditional rendering techniques.<br>
Additionally, the app integrates with the Google Geolocation API to display location-based data. I hope you enjoy exploring it, and I'm open to any suggestions or contributions to enhance my skills in React development.
